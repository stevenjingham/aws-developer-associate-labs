      - To choose an AWS region consider:
        - Compliance to data goverannce and legal requirements
        - Proximity to customers to reduce latency
        - Available services (some regions do not have some services. Some are global)
        - Pricing (which varies in regions)
  - Availability zones
    - Each region has multiple availability zones (e.g. us-east-1a, e.g. us-east-1b)
    - Each AZ is one or more discrete data centres with redundant power, networking and connectivity
    - They are separated so they isolated from disasters
    - Connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency network
  - Data centres
  - Edge locations
    - Points of Presence to deliver to end users with low latency
